# CSE523-Machine-Learning-2023-Air-Quality-Prediction

Air Quality has been predicted over Ahmedabad, India using classical machine learning algorithms as a part of the course requirement of CSE523 - Machine Learning at Ahmedabad University, India.

The dataset containing various meteorological and air quality parameters was compiled using the CAMS GLobal Reanalysis Data - EAC4 (https://ads.atmosphere.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/cams-global-reanalysis-eac4?tab=form). An Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to visualize relationships between different features of the dataset. Correlation analysis & Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were applied on the dataset to select the most important features from the dataset. Various machine learning models such as linear models, kernel-based models, gradient boosting models were developed and evaluated via metrics such as r^2 score, mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, root mean square error using scikit-learn library of python. Gradient Boosting models were observed to perform best on the dataset.
